    <h3> Basic Information </h3>
    Cryptic hunts, by their very nature, are <i> cryptic </i>. The levels therefore are never meant to be straight maps to the answer - and some clues, on first inspection, may be misleading. You have an infinite number of attempts to answer though - and are not penalized for incorrect answers, so don't hesitate when it comes to potential answers.

    <h3> More Basic Information </h3>
    <ul>
    <li>
    Spamming the portal is welcomed - unless you're brute forcing by alphabet or DDoSing, you should be good.
    </li>
    <li>
 All answers must be in lowercase, and spaces are not allowed in the answer. If you think the answer is Maitreyi Mittal, then you should type in maitreyimittal in the box.
