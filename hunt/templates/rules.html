    <h3> Basic Information </h3>
    Cryptic hunts, by their very nature, are <i> cryptic </i>. The levels therefore are never meant to be straight maps to the answer - and some clues, on first inspection, may be misleading. You have an infinite number of attempts to answer though - and are not penalized for incorrect answers, so don't hesitate when it comes to potential answers.
